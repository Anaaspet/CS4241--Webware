Webware: Assignment 3

README

This website functions as follows:
-The upper and lower bounds are generated by ruby and then the HTML page is served up
-The user guesses the correct answer
-His or her guesses are checked to be valid (within the range and is a number)
-The user at any time can ask for a new target number, or to play the game with new numbers (target and bounds)
-If the user asks for a new target, AJAX is used to get a new target number from the server, within passed-in bounds
-If the user asks to play with totally new numbers, new bounds are made in JavaScript, then the above step occurs 

Files and Directory:
GEMFILE specifying ruby and sinatra types
PROCFILE containing ruby compilation commands 
Public directory containing all linked files (CSS, and Javascript within Scripts sub-directory)
Views directory holding the served up HTML in the form of a ruby template
web.rb file that is run on the server that serves the .erb file and generates targets and bounds
